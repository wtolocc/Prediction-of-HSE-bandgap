# Prediction-of-HSE-bandgap
Using the formula and/or PBE bandgap, HSE bandgap can be predicted with different accuracy
Usage: run the main.py and input the dimension, formula, or/and PBE bandgap according to the prompt. if the model cannot be load due to different versions, please run initialize_model.py
predicted_materials_project_database contains more than 60,000 predicted HSE bandgaps values
